PROJECT DESCRIPTION

You are a Data Analyst tasked with analyzing financial data to provide insights and recommendations for improving budget performance and identifying cost-saving opportunities.
Your goal is to track revenue, expenses, and profits across different product categories and regions using the financial dataset. 
The insights derived from your analysis will inform decision-making and strategic planning for future budgeting.

For this project, I was expected to submit the following:

Cleaned Data:

Ensure that the dataset is free of errors, missing values, and inconsistencies.

Report:

A summary of your findings based on data analysis, addressing the key financial insights related to revenue, expenses, and profits. The report should provide recommendations for improving budget performance and identifying cost-saving measures.

Dashboard:

Visual representations of key metrics include total revenue, expenses by product category and region, and profits. All visualizations should be consolidated into a single Excel worksheet for a comprehensive overview.
